  # ----- 1Q84 - Haruki Murakami ----- #
    "If you can love someone with your whole heart, even one person, then there's salvation in life. Even if you "
    "can't get together with that person.",

    "I can bear any pain as long as it has meaning.",

    "Thats what the world is, after all: an endless battle of contrasting memories.",

    "Im a very ordinary human being; I just happen to like reading books.",

    "It is not that the meaning cannot be explained. But there are certain meanings that are lost forever the moment "
    "they are explained in words.",

    "Even if we could turn back, we'd probably never end up where we started.",

    "I'm tired of living unable to love anyone. I don't have a single friend - not one. And, worst of all, "
    "I can't even love myself. Why is that? Why can't I love myself? It's because I can't love anyone else. A person "
    "learns how to love himself through the simple acts of loving and being loved by someone else. Do you understand "
    "what I am saying? A person who is incapable of loving another cannot properly love himself.",

    "You can keep as quiet as you like, but one of these days somebody is going to find you.",

    "If you can't understand it without an explanation, you can't understand it with an explanation.",

    "Find me now. Before someone else does.",

    "Life is not like water. Things in life don't necessarily flow over the shortest possible route.",

    "In a sense, I'm the one who ruined me: I did it myself.",

    "I am nothing. I’m like someone who’s been thrown into the ocean at night, floating all alone. I reach out, "
    "but no one is there. I call out, but no one answers. I have no connection to anything.",

    "What I want is for the two of us to meet somewhere by chance one day, like, passing on the street, or getting on "
    "the same bus.",

    "Loneliness becomes an acid that eats away at you.",

    "As I see it, you are living with something that you keep hidden deep inside. Something heavy. I felt it from the "
    "first time I met you. You have a strong gaze, as if you have made up your mind about something. To tell you the "
    "truth, I myself carry such things around inside. Heavy things. That is how I can see it in you.",

    "I've been lonely for so long. And I've been hurt so deeply. If only I could have met you again a long time ago, "
    "then I wouldn't have had to take all these detours to get here.",

    "Tengo shook his head. 'I don't think so. This way is just fine. This is exactly the right time. For both of us. "
    "[...] We needed that much time.... to understand how lonely we really were.",

    "But there are certain meanings that are lost forever the moment they are explained in words.",

    "A person learns how to love himself through the simple acts of loving and being loved by someone else.",

    "As if to build a fence around the fatal emptiness inside her, she had to create a sunny person that she became. "
    "But if you peeled away the ornamental egos that she had built, there was only an abbys of nothingness and the "
    "intense thirst that came with it. Though she tried to forget it, the nothingness would visit her periodically - "
    "on a lonely rainy afternoon, or at dawn when she woke up from a nightmare. What she needed at such times was to "
    "be held by someone, anyone.",

    "I'm a coward when it comes to matters of the heart. That is my fatal flaw.",

    "Everyone, deep in their hearts, is waiting for the end of the world to come.",

    "Wasn't it better if they kept this desire to see each other hidden within them, and never actually got together? "
    "That way, there would always be hope in their hearts. That hope would be a small, yet vital flame that warmed "
    "them to their core-- a tiny flame to cup one's hands around and protect from the wind, a flame that the violent "
    "winds of reality might easily extinguish.",

    "Knowledge and ability were tools, not things to show off.",

    "Life is so uncertain: you never know what could happen. One way to deal with that is to keep your pajamas washed.",

    "It's just that you're about to do something out of the ordinary. And after you do something like that, "
    "the everyday look of things might seem to change a little. Things may look different to you than they did "
    "before. But don't let appearances fool you. There's always only one reality.",

    "Please remember: things are not what they seem.",

    'The moon had been observing the earth close-up longer than anyone. It must have witnessed all of the phenomena '
    'occurring - and all of the acts carried out - on this earth. But the moon remained silent; it told no stories. '
    'All it did was embrace the heavy past with a cool, measured detachment. On the moon there was neither air nor '
    'wind. Its vacuum was perfect for preserving memories unscathed. No one could unlock the heart of the moon. '
    'Aomame raised her glass to the moon and asked, "Have you gone to bed with someone in your arms lately?" The moon '
    'did not answer. "Do you have any friends?" she asked. The moon did not answer. "Don’t you get tired of always '
    'playing it cool?" The moon did not answer.',

    "What we call the present is given shape by an accumulation of the past.",

    "They sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely "
    "anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be "
    "found by your 100% perfect other. It's a miracle, a cosmic miracle.",

    "Whenever she felt like crying, she would instead become angry—at someone else or at herself—which meant that it "
    "was rare for her to shed tears.",

    "Once you pass a certain age, life becomes nothing more than a process of continual loss. Things that are "
    "important to your life begin to slip out of your grasp, one after another, like a come losing teeth. And the "
    "only things "
    "that come to take their place are worthless imitations. Your physical strength, your hopes, your dreams, "
    "your ideals, your convictions, all meaning, or then again, the people you love: one by one, they fade away. Some "
    "announce their departure before they leave, while others just disappear all of a sudden without warning one day. "
    "And once you lose them you can never get them back. Your search for replacements never goes well. It’s all very "
    "painful – as painful as actually being cut with a knife.",
    "The body is not the only target of rape. Violence does not always take a visible form, and not all wounds gush "
    "blood. "
  
    # ----- The Glass Bees - Ernst Junger ----- #
    "Some people are allergic to strawberries or lobster or any red foods and cannot even look at them. Others, "
    "like myself, for instance, cannot bear to see cut-off ears ",

    "All the systems which explain so precisely why the world is as it is and why it can never be otherwise, "
    "have always called forth in me the same kind of uneasiness one has when face to face with the regulations "
    "displayed under the glaring lights of a prison cell. Even if one had been born in prison and had never seen the "
    "stars or seas or woods, one would instinctively know of timeless freedom in unlimited space.",
